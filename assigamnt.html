        <h3>Subjects of study
        </h3>
        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall
            somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
            the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued
            by are as follows, in order of priority:were most intrigued
by are as follows, in order of priority:
            </p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Turning HO into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C\4H)203.)</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the

                    audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 increasing to 3 x 10*.)
                    </li>
                <li>H . and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
                research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
                </p>

        <h3>Exotic dance moves
        </h3>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,
            my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Polynesian chicken dance
                </dt>
                <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around
                    in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle
                    </dt>
                    <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
                        involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
                        tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired
                        modern styles such as Twerking.
                        </dd>
                    <dt>Arctic robot dance
                    </dt>
                    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
                        discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants
                        of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
                        because they were really cold.
